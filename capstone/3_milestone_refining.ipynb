    "# Which country will first-time airbnb users choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Brief\n",
    "New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb wants to predict in which destination country a new user from the USA will make his or her first booking:\n",
    "1. United States of America\n",
    "2. France\n",
    "3. Canada\n",
    "4. Great Britain\n",
    "5. Estonia\n",
    "6. Italy\n",
    "7. Portugal\n",
    "8. Netherlands\n",
    "9. Germany\n",
    "10. Australia  \n",
    "11. No Destination Found (NDF) \n",
    "12. Other\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "The data has been provided by airbnb and downloaded from Kaggle. And the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data) contains a rich set of demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics data on about 275,562 (train + test) users from the USA. For context, I've also explored the [international](http://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2015-O-001/index.html) and [domestic](http://www.statista.com/statistics/207103/forecasted-number-of-domestic-trips-in-the-us/) travel data for US Citizens for 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is [NDCG (Normalized discounted cumulative gain)](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/NormalizedDiscountedCumulativeGain) @k where k=5. NDCG is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$DCG_k=\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2^{rel_i}-1}{\\log_2{\\left(i+1\\right)}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$IDCG_k$ is the maximum possible (ideal) $DCG$ for a given set of queries, documents, and relevances. All NDCG calculations are relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$nDCG_k=\\frac{DCG_k}{IDCG_k},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each new user, you are to make a maximum of 5 predictions on the country of the first booking. The ground truth country is marked with relevance = 1, while the rest have relevance = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if for a particular user the destination is FR, then the predictions become:\n",
    "\n",
    "[ FR ]  gives a $NDCG=\\frac{2^{1}-1}{log_{2}(1+1)}=1.0$\n",
    "\n",
    "[ US, FR ] gives a $DCG=\\frac{2^{0}-1}{log_{2}(1+1)}+\\frac{2^{1}-1}{log_{2}(2+1)}=\\frac{1}{1.58496}=0.6309$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "1. before early 2013 users could make bookings without creating an account\n",
    "2. where date_fisrt_booking is populated with nana the destination country is also given as NDF\n",
    "3. missing data or data munging that need to be done?\n",
    "4. outliers?\n",
    "5. unbalanced dataset, skewed to NDF\n",
    "3. What are the similarities/differences in the destination countries?\n",
    "4. Demographic differences that could point to preferences?\n",
    "5. Investigate the impact that user interaction with the website has on destination selection."

    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Going in, *my hunch* is that *he majority of first time US airbnb users will choose destinations within the USA and then tend to favour Canada and European countries to Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is based on data for [international travel](http://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2015-O-001/index.html) by U.S. citizens for the first 10 months of 2015, where all of Europe saw 11,067,879 U.S. citizens (18% of 61,322,698), just above the Canadian figure (11,008,848 citizens; 18%), but still half of number going to Mexico (22,641,533; 36.9% of total). Oceania (used as proxy for Australia in this example) saw 0.8% (511,563) of U.S. citizens visit their shores. In terms of [domestic travel](http://www.statista.com/statistics/207103/forecasted-number-of-domestic-trips-in-the-us/), U.S. citizens took 458.3 million business trips and 1,692.8 million leisure trips in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I will be exploring:\n",
    "1. data integrity:\n",
    "  * the level of missing data \n",
    "  * impact of outliers \n",
    "  * the amount of data cleaning that will be required before anlaysis can be done\n",
    "\n",
    "2. testing feature characteristics that could point to country preferences:\n",
    "  * demographic (age, language, gender)\n",
    "  * how the user come to the website initially (affiliate_channel, affiliate_provider, first_affiliate_tracked)\n",
    "  * how the user interacts with the website (first_browser,first_device_type)\n",
    "  * impact of signup process (signup_app, signup_flow, signup_method) on whether the person ends up making a booking or not.\n",
    "  * after creating an account (date_account_created), what is the delay in searching for places to stay (timestamp_first_active)? And post account creation, how long does it take to finalize the booking (date_first_booking)? And what kind of prediction accuracy do these indicators have?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. external influencers about the destination countries themselves that could be attractive to certain users\"\n",
    " * the distance to the destination (distance_km)\n",
    " * how big the country is could potentially point to there being more to explore (destination_km2)\n",
    " * foreign, but familiar. Whether english is widely-spoken in the destination country has an impact on it's desirability (destination_language, language_levenshtein_distance)\n",
